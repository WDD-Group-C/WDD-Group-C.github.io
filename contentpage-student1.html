                            Microplastics, tiny plastic particles less than 5mm in size, are pervasive in marine environments. These particles are ingested by a wide range of marine organisms, from tiny zooplankton to large whales. Ingesting microplastics can cause physical harm, such as blockages in the digestive systems of marine animals, and chemical harm, as microplastics often carry toxic substances. The presence of microplastics in the food chain can lead to bioaccumulation, posing health risks to higher trophic levels, including humans who consume seafood.

                            Plastic pollution disrupts marine habitats by smothering coral reefs, seagrass beds, and mangrove forests, essential ecosystems for marine life. For instance, plastic debris can block sunlight, hindering photosynthesis in aquatic plants, and can physically damage delicate coral structures. The alteration of these habitats not only affects the species that directly rely on them but also has cascading effects on the broader marine ecosystem. This habitat disruption can reduce biodiversity and resilience against environmental changes.

                            Marine biodiversity is severely threatened by plastic pollution, with numerous species facing increased risk of entanglement and ingestion. Sea turtles often mistake plastic bags for jellyfish, a primary food source, leading to fatal consequences. Seabirds, fish, and marine mammals are also affected, with many found dead with stomachs full of plastic. The decline in species populations due to plastic pollution has far-reaching implications, disrupting predator-prey relationships and weakening the overall health of marine ecosystems

                            Plastic pollution carries significant economic costs, particularly impacting fisheries and tourism industries. Coastal communities that depend on clean oceans for their livelihoods suffer as fish stocks decline and beaches become polluted. The cost of cleaning up plastic waste and the loss of revenue from diminished tourism can be substantial. Addressing plastic pollution requires comprehensive strategies, including robust policies, increased public awareness, and community-driven initiatives to reduce plastic use and improve waste management practices.
