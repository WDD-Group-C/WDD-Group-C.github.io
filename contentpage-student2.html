                <li>Decline in fish populations and potential extinction of vulnerable species, disrupting marine food webs and ecosystems</li>
                <li>Damage to important habitats like coral reefs that rely on diverse fish populations</li>
                <li>Reduced food security and economic livelihoods for millions of people who rely on fishing for protein and income</li>
                <li>Devastating impacts on coastal communities, with the collapse of major fisheries leading to job losses and the erosion of traditional ways of life</li>
                <li>Broader environmental effects, as the removal of keystone species can have ripple effects throughout the entire marine ecosystem </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Overfishing has severe socio-economic consequences, particularly for coastal communities that rely on fishing as a primary source of food and income. The depletion of fish stocks due to overfishing can lead to a loss of livelihoods and jobs for millions of people employed in the fishing industry and related sectors. This can devastate local economies, as the fishing industry is of great importance to developing countries. 

                Without access to seafood, many coastal communities face issues of food scarcity and malnutrition, threatening their food security. The economic losses from overfishing are estimated at around $50 billion annually on a global scale. Overfishing can also disrupt important marine ecosystems, damaging industries like tourism that rely on healthy oceans. 
                
                Overall, the socio-economic impacts of overfishing extend far beyond just the fishing industry, impacting coastal communities, food security, and broader economic development, particularly in developing regions that are most dependent on marine resources. Addressing overfishing is crucial to ensuring the long-term sustainability of both marine ecosystems and the human communities that depend on them.</p><br>

            <h3>03. Current Fisheries Management Policies and Practices</h3>

            <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
                <img src="images/IUU-Fishing-infographic-3-1.png" alt="" style="height: 800px; width: 30%; margin-right: 5%; margin-top:0; margin-left: 6%;">
                <p style="flex: 1; margin-left: 10px;">
                    There is often a lack of effective regulations and enforcement to limit overfishing in many regions. Perverse subsidies that incentivize unsustainable fishing practices remain a significant problem. Monitoring and controlling illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing continues to be a major challenge for fisheries managers.<br><br>

                    Many fisheries management approaches have historically been reactive, focused on addressing immediate crises rather than proactively pursuing long-term sustainability. There is a need for more science-based management approaches that incorporate ecological, economic, and social factors to set appropriate catch limits, quotas, and other controls.<br><br>

                    While some regional fisheries management organizations have adopted the precautionary approach, the implementation has been uneven. There is a lack of consistent use of reference points, harvest control rules, and management procedures across different fisheries. Addressing scientific uncertainty and data limitations remains an ongoing challenge.<br><br>

                    Overall, the research indicates that substantial improvements are needed in current fisheries management policies and practices to ensure the long-term health and sustainability of marine ecosystems and the communities that depend on them. A more proactive, holistic, and science-based approach is required to overcome the persistent problems of overfishing and unsustainable exploitation of global fisheries.

            <h3>04. Sustainable Fishing Practices and Policies</h3>
            <hr style="border: 2px solid black;"><br>
            <div class="cnt-pg-img"></div>
            <p>Implementing catch limits, quotas and other input/output controls to prevent overfishing. Establishing and enforcing marine protected areas (MPAs) to allow fish stocks to recover. Promoting stakeholder engagement and co-management of fisheries. Adopting bycatch reduction techniques and gear modifications to minimize environmental impacts. Expanding sustainable aquaculture as a complement to wild-caught fisheries. Increasing consumer awareness and demand for eco-labeled sustainable seafood.
                <br><br>
                <img src="images/img12.jpg" alt="" style="height: 700px; width: 80%;margin-left: 10%;">
                <br><br>
                Sustainable fishing practices must be based on the best available science to set appropriate catch limits and protect vulnerable species and habitats. Adaptive management approaches that respond to changing conditions are also critical. By balancing ecological, economic and social factors, sustainable fisheries management can ensure the long-term viability of our ocean resources for future generations.
