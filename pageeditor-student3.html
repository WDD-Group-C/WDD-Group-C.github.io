        <h3>Profile</h3>
        <div class="textcntent">
          <p>
            Created a profile page using a custom Javascript prompt made of contenteditable divs
            that covers 3 steps and prompts the user 12 times.It covers details such as the user's personal details, 
            contact information and their motivation and contribution towards our goal. It also dynamically shows the user their current
            output and allows users to skip prompts and return to fill them out later. The page contains a guide to the side on how to operate
            the web page and also has fully functional keyboard controls for accessability.

            Created a team page showcasing all the contributors responsible for the design of the website. It details each team members
            role and the pages they have created when hovering. Used CSS to create an animation where the opacity changes when hovering over
            a team member's profile picture

          <p>
            Created a content page which covers the topic "Coral reef degradation and restoration efforts". Discusses why we should care 
            and the effects of climate change and pollution on coral reefs and how we can restore them and what the impact would be
            globally.

        <h3>Learnt</h3>
        <div class="textcontent">
          <p>
            During the coursework, I have learnt about different Javascript like "querySelectorAll" and "reduce". Also learnt about different event listeners
            which are mainly used for designing the profile page. Also learnt about various CSS properties like flex, animation and also @media rules which are used
            in the profile page for users who prefer reduced motion and also used for styling screens with smaller widths. I also learnt about different
            vendor specific properties using prefixes like -webkit-, -moz-, etc... so that the all the components of the webpage are functional for different
            devices. Also learnt about tags like "aside" which was used to design the guide of my profile page or "figure" which was used for all images
            in the pages that I have created.
