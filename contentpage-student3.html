          Coral reefs are vital ecosystems that support a diverse array of marine life and play a crucial role in sustaining our planet's health.
          However, these intricate underwater structures face severe threats from human activities, climate change, and environmental degradation. 
          As coral reefs decline, so too does their ability to provide essential benefits to both marine life and human communities worldwide.

            Global warming causes coral bleaching by increasing sea temperatures, prompting corals to expel symbiotic algae essential 
            for their health and color. This process weakens corals, making them more vulnerable to disease and death. 
            Severe or frequent bleaching events threaten coral ecosystems, impacting marine biodiversity and vital coastal services. 
            Mitigating climate change through global emission reductions and local conservation efforts is crucial for protecting coral 
            reefs and their ecological and socio-economic significance.

            Pollution harms coral reefs by increasing sedimentation, nutrient levels, and chemical contaminants, which smother corals,
            disrupt symbiotic relationships, fuel algal growth, and directly poison corals, compromising their health and resilience to other
            stressors like climate change.

            Efforts to restore coral reefs involve various initiatives aimed at enhancing their health and resilience. 
            These include measures to improve water quality, reduce pollution, and manage fishing practices sustainably.
            Community engagement plays a crucial role in fostering local stewardship and knowledge sharing, contributing 
            to the preservation of coral biodiversity and supporting the livelihoods of coastal communities dependent on healthy reef ecosystems.
